## Aggelos Biboudis

My name is Aggelos Biboudis (Άγγελος Μπιμπούδης in Greek) and I’m a PhD student
at Dept. of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, under the
supervision of Yannis Smaragdakis since July 2012.

You can contact me on LinkedIn and Google+. You can also find bits of my work
under my Github page. I also maintain a blog (low-traffic). I like tweeting
about PL, computer science and geek stuff.

  - Project: mobiXeyes
- Wireless Sensor Networks: In the field of WSN I worked on sensor data fusion (through evidence theory) and modular application development for sensor networks.
